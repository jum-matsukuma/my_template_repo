# SKILLS Directory

This directory contains skill definitions that help Claude Code understand the capabilities and context of your development environment.

## Structure

- **core/**: General development skills and capabilities
- **project/**: Project-specific skills and context
- **templates/**: Templates for creating new skill files

## Usage

Skills are automatically loaded by Claude Code to provide context about:
- Available technologies and frameworks
- Development workflows and processes
- Project-specific domain knowledge
- Custom tools and utilities

## Creating New Skills

Use the templates in `templates/` to create project-specific skills. Copy a template to the `project/` directory and customize it for your needs.

## Best Practices

- Keep skills focused and specific
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include practical examples where applicable
- Update skills as the project evolves
